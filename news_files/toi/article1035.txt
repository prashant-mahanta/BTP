NEW DELHI: That Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni like fast cars is no secret. But sometimes the two Indian superstars settle for a slower moving vehicle as well. Like they did after the first ODI vs New Zealand on Wednesday.In a video on social media, posted by the BCCI, Kohli and Dhoni were seen enjoying rides on a self-balancing two-wheeler, often used by camera crews, after India’s victory.Kohli, who scored 45 off 59 balls in the Napier ODI, will miss the last two matches of the ongoing five-match ODI series and the three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series against the Black Caps. The Indian captain has been rested, keeping in mind his workload. Rohit Sharma will lead the team in Kohli's absence.

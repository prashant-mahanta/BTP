Winning skipper Virat Kohli said: "Amazing. Three clinical games for us. Couldn't have asked for a better performance after the first two clinical games. The relentlessness of the side is something that really pleases me. We really enjoy ourselves and the guys believe in their skills and they are showing it on the field. When a guy doesn't get runs in a couple of games the opposition still feels that he's gonna fire. I haven't had a break for a long time. It's been hectic. I can relax and enjoy my break. Some day someone has to take your place and that's how it goes. Shubman is a very exciting talent and I saw him bat in the nets and I was like wow I was not even ten percent of that when I was 19."After losing the match, Kane Williamson, said: "They are a very good side and they are teaching us a lesson. There are improvements today and we want to appreciate some of the lessons we have learnt from their side. The consistency about their plans and the way they forced some mistakes I guess we gotta be better than that. The margins are large in white cricket but it does require a lot of improvement. I think everybody is wanting to contribute more. The wicket was tough and the partnership between Latham and Ross was outstanding. I think we are going okay with the ball in hand. We need early wickets to put pressure on the opposition."Karthik slog sweeps for four moreRayudu cuts a Ferguson delivery over the keeperKarthik pulls a Ferguson delivery to the mid-wicket fenceRayudu pulls to the mid-wicket fenceBoult back in the attack and Karthik pulls the first delivery to the mid-wicket fenceKarthik hits a Santner delivery through the coversRayudu hits over the coversRayudu hits a Santner delivery inside-out over extra coverKohli straight drives off FergusonKohli cuts to the third man fenceRohit hits a Bracewell delivery to the mid-wicket fenceKohli rocks on the back foot against Sodhi and pulls to the mid-wicket fenceKohli cuts a Ferguson delivery through point for his first boundaryRohit glances a Bracewell delivery to the fine leg fenceDhawan cover drives a Boult delivery for his sixth boundaryDhawan gloves off a brute of a bouncer off Boult over the keeperDhawan square cuts for his fourth boundary, all off BracewellRohit flicks a Bracewell delivery to the mid-wicket fenceDhawan flicks to the mid-wicket fenceDhawan cuts between point and coverDhawan cover drives for the first boundary of the Indian run chaseShikhar Dhawan cover drives for two to get off the markRohit Sharma edges to fine leg for a single to get off the markTaylor looks to pull but gets a top edge off Pandya's slower ball that goes behind the keeperTaylor flicks a Shami delivery to the fine leg fenceBracewell hits a Bhuvneshwar delivery through the coversTaylor cuts a Bhuvneshwar delivery to the third man fenceTaylor cuts a wrong'un from Kuldeep through point for his sixth bioundaryTaylor smashes a Jadhav delivery through the coversPandya pitches it short and Taylor pulls to the mid-wicket fenceTaylor cuts a Pandya delivery to the third man fenceLatham sweeps a Kuldeep delivery to deep square leg, misfield by Ambati Rayudu at the boundaryLatham gets a leading edge, that goes straight back but it is across the pitch, tough chance for Shami50 up for New Zealand as Williamson flicks a Chahal delivery to the mid-wicket fenceWilliamson cuts between cover and pointWilliamson straight drives a Bhuvneshwar delivery for his second boundaryWilliamson hits a Shami delivery through the covers for his first boundaryGuptill flicks to the mid-wicket fenceDinesh Karthik dives but drops a tough low chance to his leftMunro hits straight over the top for the first boundary of the matchMohammed Shami bowls the second over, starts round the wicket to Colin MunroBhuvneshwar Kumar bowls the first over of the match, Martin Guptill on strikeNew Zealand captain Kane Williamson won the toss and chose to bat against India in the third ODI at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui.MS Dhoni is out with a hamstring strain and he is replaced by Dinesh Karthik.

NEW DELHI: Age is just a number and veteran Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni rightly proved it by running out James Neesham using his sharp mind together with instinctive skills during the fifth and final ODI against New Zealand at Wellington on Sunday.At 37, wily Dhoni effected Neesham's freak run out from behind the stumps to turn the match in India's favour.The run out came soon after a lbw appeal was turned down and it was a huge wicket for India at that stage as it had brought the required run rate under 6 per-over with 14 overs left to play. New Zealand 253-run chase eventually ended with 217 in 44.1 overs despite Matt Henry's unbeaten 17 off 9 in the final over.The run out happened in the 37th over of the NZ innings when Neesham, who was looking dangerous, was batting on 44. It was an lbw appeal from Kedar Jadhav and Dhoni but umpire Shaun George was not interested. But Neesham, keen on watching the umpire's reaction, didn't realise he was way outside the crease and Dhoni's showed great presence of mind and hit the stumps with a direct throw to produce a magical run-out. The New Zealander smashed four boundaries and two sixes in his knock.India finally earned a hard fought 35-run win over New Zealand to finish the series with a 4-1 scoreline in their favour, proving the heavy loss at Hamilton was an aberration.

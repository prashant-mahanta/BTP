IND vs NZ 3rd ODI: When, where, how to watch and follow the live streaming of 3rd ODI between India and New Zealand
NEW DELHI: A well-deserved break coming up, India captain Virat Kohli will be aiming to seal the five-match series when his team squares off against a confused New Zealand in the third ODI at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui , New Zealand on Monday.The Indian captain has been given a break as part of BCCI's workload management programme and he would ensure that he finishes his assignment Down Under on a high after the maiden Test and ODI victories in Australia.An unassailable 3-0 lead would be a fitting revenge to India's abject 0-4 humiliation during the 2014 limited-overs series.One of the primary focus of Monday's encounter could be inclusion of Indian cricket's latest enfant terrible Hardik Pandya , who is coming back from provisional suspension for his loose talk on a TV chat show.Pandya's presence lends solidity and balance to the side, and the skipper has time and again admitted it. The Baroda all-rounder's replacement Vijay Shankar is a decent cricketer but is yet to possess the X factor that Pandya has.New Zealand, on the other hand, have looked clueless against India's wrist-spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, who accounted for 12 of the 20 wickets in the last two ODIs.Kuldeep has looked the most menacing as he claimed two four-wicket hauls in the first two ODIs, while Chahal returned with two wickets on both the matches.Seamers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami also have done their job well, getting crucial breakthroughs for the team.India's batting too has complemented the bowlers, looking rock solid in both the games with Shikhar Dhawan 's return to form lending the team the much-needed support at the top.After scoring an unbeaten 75 in the first ODI, he cracked a 67-ball 66 in the second game.

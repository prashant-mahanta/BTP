NEW DELHI: Former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni once again earned lot of praise from cricket fans for his sharp mind behind the stumps during the first one-day international against New Zealand on Wednesday.India won the series opener by eight wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series in Napier. But what got the attention of many fans was Dhoni's accurate reading of the opposition batsman and the instructions he gave to the chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav , as the spinner worked to finish off the hosts' tail.The incident happened when Yadav was bowling to New Zealand's No. 11 Trent Boult in the 38th over with the hosts struggling at 157/9."Yeh aank band karke rokega. Dusra waala daal sakta hai isko," Dhoni was caught saying on the stumps mic, suggesting Yadav to bowl a googly. The spinner followed the instructions and Boult gave Rohit Sharma a simple catch at the first slip as the NZ innings ended on 157 in 38 overs.

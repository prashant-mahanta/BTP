NEW DELHI: The criticism leveled at Hardik Pandya over the past few weeks doesn't seem to have affected his on field performances. The all-rounder made a significant contribution in India's series clinching win against New Zealand on Monday.Coming back into the playing XI after the suspension on him for sexist comments on a TV show was lifted, Pandya delivered figures of 2 wickets for 45 runs in 10 overs and choked the run flow during the middle overs.Apart from his impressive figures, the all-rounder also took a stunning catch to dismiss New Zealand captain Kane Williamson In the 17th over of the New Zealand's innings, skipper Williamson came down the track to leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and tried to whip the ball off his pads.An alert Pandya, who was fielding at the mid-wicket region, dived to his left and completed a blinder of a catch to send the New Zealand skipper back to the pavilion.

Is India the team to beat at the ICC World Cup?
A seven-wicket win in the third ODI at Mount Maunganui on Monday meant India sealed the ODI series against New Zealand 3-0, with two games remaining. That ended a decade-long wait for an ODI series win in New Zealand.As with the previous two matches, India once again dominated the hosts in all aspects at the Bay Oval. This against a team that boasts the best win-loss ratio at home since the last World Cup. In fact, it's the first time the Kiwis lost three consecutive ODIs at home since 2013, and the first instance of losing three straight matches in a bilateral home series since March 2012.New Zealand — whose batting line-up includes Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor — have been unable to bat their full quota of 50 overs on all three occasions. Little wonder then that they have had just one century partnership so far. And this is an Indian lineup without, perhaps, the best white-ball bowler in world cricket currently: Jasprit Bumrah.But the Indian bowlers have still given sleepless nights to the New Zealand batsmen. Mohammed Shami picked up the Man-of-the-Match award in the first and third ODI. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal have taken 14 wickets between them and also extracted more out of the pitches compared to Kiwi spinners.The success in New Zealand makes it three series victories for India outside Asia in the last one year, starting with the 5-1 hammering of South Africa in February 2018, a tighter 2-1 scoreline against Australia this month and now another easy win against the Black Caps.Does that make India the team to beat at the coming World Cup England? You won't bet against it.

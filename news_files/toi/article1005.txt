NEW DELHI: Having already pocketed the five-match ODI series with an unassailable 3-0 lead against New Zealand, Indian skipper Virat Kohli is off to vacations with wife Anushka Sharma after being rested for the last two ODIs and subsequently three-match T20I series.Virat Kohli posted a picture with Anushka on Twitter, captioning: "Away we go".Indian team completely dominated an out of sorts New Zealand for a series-clinching seven-wicket win in the third ODI on Monday with seven overs to spare, continuing to send a resounding message of its near invincibility to every World Cup opposition.Kohli signed off his tour Down Under on a high with a first ODI series win in New Zealand in 10 years. However, it is to be noted that prior to this, India played just one series here since 2009.It was a complete team effort after the bowlers shot New Zealand out for 243 in 49 overs with all-rounder Hardik Pandya (2/45 in 10 overs). Kohli's 60 off 74 deliveries and a 113-run partnership with Rohit Sharma formed the backbone of India's run chase.

virat kohli: India vs New Zealand: Top five highest ODI scores in New Zealand
NEW DELHI: Ahead of the ODI series between India and New Zealand, here's a look at the five highest scores in New Zealand, in one-dayers played between India and New Zealand. Incredibly four of the top five highest scores have been registered by Indian batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar opened the innings for India in an ODI for the first time in New Zealand. It was in 1994 in Auckland. On March 8, 2009, Tendulkar's unbeaten 163 in the third ODI of the series in Christchurch was his 43rd ODI century and his first in New Zealand. Tendulkar took the Kiwi attack to the cleaners, smashing 5 sixes and 16 fours in his knock that came off 133 balls. Had he not retired hurt in the 45th over due to a sore muscle, he was on track to become the first double-centurion in ODI cricket, a year before he actually went on to achieve the feat, in 2010. Tendulkar's knock, coupled with Yuvraj Singh 's 87 and captain MS Dhoni's 68 powered India to 392/4 in their 50 overs. Tendulkar's century went on to become his 31st hundred in a victory as India won the match by 58 runs.A typically unabashed Virender Sehwag knock, in which he smashed 6 sixes and 14 fours, in the fourth ODI on March 11, 2009. Sehwag reached his century with a six and it came off 60 balls, which at that time was India's fastest one-day hundred. The Indian run chase was marred by three rain interruptions, but it affected neither Sehwag's concentration nor his strokeplay, as the opener simply dismissed the Kiwi bowlers with utter disdain, overshadowing fellow opener Gautam Gambhir 's 67-ball 63. India, batting second were 201/0 in 23.3 overs when play was interrupted for the third time due to rain and the revised target was 197, which the visitors had already crossed. Sehwag's blitzkrieg knock not only ensured India's 84-run win (D/L method) but it also secured India's maiden one-day series triumph in New Zealand.This was before the 1999 ICC World Cup and this knock was just a sign of things to come. Rahul Dravid , who in the early part of his career was not regarded to be a very effective ODI player, finished as the highest run-scorer in the 1999 World Cup. And it was this knock that provided a glimpse of what a fine ODI player Dravid would go on to become. In the first ODI of the series and the first ever ODI at Taupo on January 9, 1999, Dravid registered his second ODI hundred, after captain Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and opted to bat. Sachin Tendulkar fell for a duck in the third over, but Dravid and Sourav Ganguly put up a 113-run stand for the second wicket. Dravid hit a six and 10 fours in his run-a-ball unbeaten knock to take India to 257/5 in their 50 overs. New Zealand though won the match by 5 wickets (D/L method).One of those rare instances when Virat Kohli hit a century in a run chase but finished on the losing side. It happened in the first ODI of the series in Napier on January 19, 2014. Kohli was just about starting to make his mark as the 'Chase Master' in international cricket and this knock was one of the first displays of scintillating strokeplay that the world would sit back and enjoy. Chasing a stiff 293-run target, Kohli, in his first outing in New Zealand, arrived at the crease in the sixth over and just smashed his way to a 93-ball century (his 18th ODI hundred) by hitting the New Zealand bowlers to all corners of the park. Kohli's 123-run knock came off 111 balls and was studded with 2 sixes and 11 fours. But it wasn't enough as India lost the match by 24 runs.The only New Zealander on the list and it's one of the finest all-rounders to have played for the Black Caps. And it is proof of Chris Cairns ' calibre with the bat. Before he hit an unbeaten 102 in the ICC KnockOut Final against India in Nairobi on October 15, 2000, Cairns smashed an 80-ball 115 in the fifth ODI in Christchurch on January 19, 1999 vs India. Coming in to bat at number five, Cairns took the Indian bowling attack to the cleaners by smashing 7 sixes and 7 fours to power New Zealand to 300/8 in their 50 overs. Anil Kumble proved to be the most expensive among the Indian bowlers, conceding 78 runs off his 10 overs with only one wicket -- but it was Cairns' wicket. New Zealand won the match by 70 runs to draw the five-match series 2-2.

Especially after the Hamilton loss, that was a big loss for us the way we lost there. At the toss I said we needed to come together as a team and we did that. Four down, we needed someone to apply, and Rayudu and Vijay Shankar did that. The way Hardik and Kedar played was magnificent. We showed a lot of character. With the ball as well. The wicket got flat at the end, with the dew. At one point it looked like it would be an easy chase. But lot of people put their hands up and got us through. I knew there was some moisture in the pitch. If the series was on the line, I would've batted second. Wasn't easy after losing four wickets at the start. Thought 250 was a very good score on that pitch. Bowlers got crucial breakthroughs at critical times. When you want to win games, you've got to find the right balance. Coming here and beating NZ at home wasn't going to be easy. The achievement we've had today is a great achievement to have.It was a different surface which certainly was a challenge. We saw that with the ball in hand. Got away from us towards the end which probably took them at par or probably more. Scoring rate never got away from us but it was just that we lost wickets at the wrong time. They did it pretty well through Rayudu with 90. For long parts they didn't score. We knew it was going to be tough. We know how well India bowl on any surface. Their accuracy. If we could've taken the partnerships deeper, like with Tom Latham and myself, it could've been different. Credit to India throughout this series. They've taught us a few lessons in our own conditions. They're a world class outfit, they deserve the series win. We need to learn from these lessons. It's a game of pressure. Throughout this series, they had us under more pressure than we would've liked.It was very tough against a quality bowling attack. Was thinking we should take the game to 30th over without losing another wicket. Our only plan was to play the full fifty overs. Especially for people batting at four, five and six, you get opportunities only when the situation is tough. Don't think setting totals has ever been an issue. That was a one-off game in Hamilton. Might face similar challenges in future.

He hopes to put up a good show after a humiliating loss in the last game. Mentions they did not have a lot of time after the first game but they will have to read the conditions better and learn from their mistakes. Further adds that had they got close to 200, the story might just have been different in the last ODI. Reckons the average total here is around 240 but if they bat well, they can get close to 300. Ends by saying that they need to assess the conditions and then take it on from there.New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson says they were looking to bowl first and make use of the early moisture. Further adds he is not sure if the ball would swing here or no but it generally does at the start. Ends by saying it is difficult to predict what a good score will be so they will try and restrict India to as low a total as possible.For India, MS Dhoni, Mohammed Shami and Vijay Shankar come in for Dinesh Karthik, Khaleel Ahmed and Kuldeep Yadav.New Zealand have brought in Colin Munro in place of an injured Martin Guptill.Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Shubman Gill, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(w), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Vijay Shankar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Yuzvendra ChahalHenry Nicholls, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham(w), James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Colin de Grandhomme, Todd Astle, Matt Henry, Trent Boult

BCCI officials question NCA COO Tufan Ghosh’s trip Down Under ‘to watch Australian Open’
The National Cricket Academy (NCA) COO Tufan Ghosh’s recent trip to Australia during the Indian team’s tour Down Under has not gone down well in certain quarters within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). While board officials have no problem with him travelling to Australia, the reason given behind his visit has raised eyebrows. The NCA COO had taken the trip with an aim to present an athlete management programme to the Indian players which supposedly never took place even as Ghosh visited the country, watched the Australian Open with some of the Indian players and returned to his base in Bangalore.

Speaking to Hindustan Times, a senior board functionary said that while Ghosh was free to travel anywhere he felt like off duty, the objective given behind the official trip and the selective approval of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) of officials/executives’ foreign trips has left a lot to be desired.

“This is truly bizzare and evidence of the CoA’s whimsical functioning. On the one hand the former CAG sits in his ivory tower singing ballads of financial prudence and on the other hand approvals are given for a sham visit to Australia for a meeting that was not even scheduled and therefore never happened! In other words it was a visit with a notional objective,” he said.

Echoing the sentiments a board official said: “I am shocked that the BCCI is spending so much money to essentially send Tufan Ghosh to watch Novak Djokovic play at the Australian Open.

“Maybe it was felt that he would be less of an embarrassment there than at the NCA where he reportedly walked into the room where India opener Prithvi Shaw was getting his ankle treated and yelled, “C’mon Prithvi! You can do it !” He is clearly chasing dragons that we can’t see.”

Sources in the know of developments told Hindustan Times that the players in the Indian team felt that the time wasn’t right for the presentation and they weren’t too keen to get their minds off the important ODI series against Australia and focus on any athlete development presentation.

When contacted, Ghosh didn’t wish to comment on the matter.

India vs New Zealand 1st T20I Live Streaming: When and Where to Watch, Live Coverage on TV and Online
India wrapped up the five-match ODI series against New Zealand with a comprehensive 4-1 scoreline. The visitors were as dominant as the scoreline suggests. They won the first three games with relative ease before suffering an uncharacteristic blip in the fourth ODI as they folded up for mere 92 runs and lost by 8 wickets.

However, they were back to their winning best with a 17-run win in the final match in Wellington.

India will now be eager to end their trip with another series win as they begin the three-match T20I campaign with the first game in Wellington on Wednesday.

Ranji Trophy 2018-19 Final, Vidarbha vs Saurashtra, Day 3 Highlights: Vidarbha build 60-run lead with 8 wickets in hand
Highlights: It was an absorbing day of cricket between the defending champions Vidarbha and the two-time finalists Saurashtra. The tail wagged brilliantly for Saurashtra with each of the last five batsmen going past the 20-run mark. Captain Jaydev Unadkat scored a 101-ball 46 to help his side to within five runs of the Vidarbha first innings total.

Dharmendrasinh Jadeja then accounted for the wickets of Faiz Fazal and Sanjay Raghunath to keep the match evenly poised. The veteran batsman and nine-time Ranji Tophy winner Wasim Jaffer, who is batting on 5, will be the key man on the fourth day for Vidarbha as they look for back-to-back titles.

16:43 hrs IST Jaffer survives! There was a scare for the Vidarbha veteran as an Unadkat delivery brushed the flap of his backfoot pad before nestling into the wicket-keeper’s gloves. Unadkat and Barot appeal vociferously but Jaffer survives. That was a close one!

14:34 hrs IST Unadkat falls He sweeps and finds the man at short square leg. Unadkat is on his haunches, Faiz Fazal exults. Chandrakant Pandit lets out a huge puff of air, Shitanshu Kotak stands up and walks away. Images screaming out a story. Vidarbha have managed to earn a 5-run lead in the first innings. Surely, this match is not ending in a draw?

10:33 hrs IST 100 for Snell Patel He has swept an angled ball for four and reaches his 2nd century for the season. Has been a dogged innings which has kept Vidarbha at bay. He needs to carry on and nibble away at the deficit.

10:01 hrs IST Saurashtra soild Mankad receives treatment for his right thumb. He has been battered today, but is holding fort. Saurashtra are showing fight against some high-quality bowling

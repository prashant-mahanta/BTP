Kraigg Brathwaite to captain West Indies in third England test
West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite will captain the team in place of the suspended Jason Holderwhen they face England in the third and final test starting in St Lucia on Saturday, Cricket West Indies said.

Brathwaite previously skippered West Indies in their series defeat by Bangladesh in November when Holder was injured.

“Our heartfelt condolences to Alzarri and his family on the passing of his mother. His heroics in the test wereoutstanding and shows a player of great character,” Browne added.

“We also welcome Keemo Paul back to the squad. He’s having a good showing in theWest Indies first-class championship.”
